# Hello-world
starting over
about me- I am just a girl, working on my own with no guide, just word on each formatted screen, trying to figure out my path. I reassure myself that I am not crazy, that source code is not too much for me, and each day set along a new path of trying to not be sad and learn new changes. Almost a year now with not giving up although everyone else has, and I finally figured out the branch thing, on another app other than github, but I am back.
